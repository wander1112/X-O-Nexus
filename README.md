# 🎮 X-O Nexus

**X-O Nexus** is an advanced and interactive take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, inspired by *Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe*.  
The game combines strategy, recursion, graph-based logic, and a clean GUI to deliver a challenging player vs CPU experience.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Built using **Python**
- Uses **Graph concepts** to model game states and winning conditions
- Features a **CPU opponent** with intelligent move selection
- Fully interactive **GUI-based game**
- Supports reset and replay functionality

This project demonstrates the practical application of:
- Data Structures (Graphs)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Game logic & decision making
- Event-driven programming

## 🕹️ Game Rules (Quick Summary)

- The board consists of **9 small Tic-Tac-Toe boards** forming one big board
- Winning a small board claims that position on the big board
- The next move location depends on the previous move
- First player to win the **big board** wins the game
- If a board is full and undecided, it is marked as a draw

## ⚙️ Features

- Player vs CPU gameplay
- Smart CPU logic:
  - Blocks winning moves
  - Attempts winning strategies
  - Prioritizes center and corners
- Visual indication of wins and draws
- Smooth UI with clear move guidance
- Reset option for replayability
