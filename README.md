## 📌 Project Overview  
Super Tic Tac Toe is an advanced and more strategic version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.  
Developed as part of our **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course, this project focuses on  
algorithmic thinking, clean code structure, and efficient game logic.

The game consists of:
- A 3×3 mega board  
- Each cell of the mega board contains a smaller Tic Tac Toe board  
- Players must win mini boards to win the larger board  
- Smart rules for directing players to specific boards
